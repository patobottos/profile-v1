          Embarking on a digital journey over a decade ago, I&#39;ve crafted
          engaging online experiences, refining my skills in ReactJS,
          JavaScript, and web technologies. As a React Front End Developer at IT
          Academy, I bring digital experiences to life, such as the timeless Nim
          game. Before this role, spanning 10 years, I worked as a WordPress Web
          Content Manager, contributing to diverse web projects, including
          personal blogs, entrepreneurs&#39; websites, and non-profit platforms.
          <br />
          <br />
          Beyond coding, I co-directed an indie film festival, attracting 2000+
          cinephiles, and led initiatives to enhance various public services.
          Recently, I successfully completed a rigorous React Front End Web
          Developer Coding Bootcamp at IT Academy in Barcelona, ensuring that I
          stay at the forefront of web development.
          <br />
          <br />
          Proficient in Catalan, Spanish, English, and French, I am passionate
          about languages and their power to connect people.
          <br />
          <br />
          I believe in the transformative potential of groups of people working
          cooperatively with a shared objective, while consistently prioritizing
          mental health and the environment.
          <br />
          <br />
          Away from screens, I send extensive global voice messages, play
          Rummikub with family, tend rooftop radishes, run on Sunday mornings,
          enjoy horror movies, engage in a school association, and participate
          in a Poblenou cohousing project.
